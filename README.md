Data Wrangling - WeRateDogs Twitter Feed

This project was completed as a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. It focuses on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs twitter feed, @dog_rates. 

Data sources:

  * An extract of tweets - `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` 
  * Programatically downloading `image_predictions.tsv` from a url
  * Querying the Twitter API to generate `tweet_json.txt

Reports:
  * The code for gathering, assessing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data is stored in `wrangle_act.ipynb`
  * The process for gathering, assessing and cleaning the data is summarized in `wrangle_report.html`
  * The visual analysis of the findings and insights are presented in `act_report.html
